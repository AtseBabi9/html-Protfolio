<h1> The Best Movies According to Eyosi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>

 <hr/>
 
 <h3> The God father </h3>
 <p>  The movie is a meditation on power, family, and loyalty, and it asks questions about what people are willing to do to protect those they love. </p>
 <h3>  The Black Panther</h3>
 <p> The first black marvel superhero that talks about a great kingdom and a king in Africa and their precious resource. It empowered black kis all around the world </p>
 <h3> ATTICA  </h3>
 <p> Attica revisits the titular riot with intelligence, compassion, and anger, presenting a version of events that honors history as much as it exemplifies the art of documentary filmmakin</p>
